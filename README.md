# calculator

This is my final project in The Odin Project's fundamental
course. The design of this project is a very simple calculator.
The calculator can only perform one function at a time and thus
will not take into account order of operations.

Attempting to perform a calculation after a result has been
displayed will reset all the variables and give a fresh start.
However, if you wish to perform another operation on the 
resultant from the previous calculation you can do so by 
selecting another operator.

As of this time I do not have the functionality of a decimal
button. Although, I do intend to add this functionality in the
future.
